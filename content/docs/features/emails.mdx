<Callout type='info'>
	We recommend Resend for sending magic login links, waitlist confirmations, and
	more. You'll need an email provider for features like magic links and
	abandoned cart emails.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### 1. Create a Resend account

- Go to [Resend](https://resend.com/) and sign up.
- In <b>Domains</b>, click <b>+ Add Domain</b>. Use a subdomain like <code>resend.yourdomain.com</code>.
- Complete all DNS verification steps. Click <b>Verify DNS Records</b> when ready (may take a few minutes).

</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Get your API key

- Go to <b>API Keys</b> in Resend.
- Click <b>+ Create API Key</b>, give it a name, and leave other options as default.
- Click <b>Add</b> and copy the API key (you'll only see it once).

Add it to your environment:

<CodeBlock title=".env.local" lang="txt">
```txt title=".env"
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@yourdomain.com
```
</CodeBlock>
</Step>

<Step>
### 3. Available email functions

Free Ship Fast includes several pre-built email functions in <code>lib/email/sendEmail.ts</code>:

- **sendMagicLinkEmail()** - Sends magic link authentication emails
- **sendPaymentSuccessEmail()** - Confirms successful payments
- **sendPaymentProcessingEmail()** - Notifies about payment processing
- **sendPaymentFailedEmail()** - Alerts about failed payments
- **sendPaymentRefundedEmail()** - Confirms payment refunds

<CodeBlock title="Usage example" lang="typescript">
```typescript
import { sendPaymentSuccessEmail } from "@/lib/email/sendEmail";

// Send a payment success email
await sendPaymentSuccessEmail(
"user@example.com",
"John Doe",
"29.99",
"txn_123456"
);

```
</CodeBlock>
</Step>

<Step>
### 4. Email templates

All email templates are in <code>lib/email/templates/</code>:

- **MagicLinkLogin** - Clean magic link email template
- **PaymentSuccessEmail** - Payment confirmation template
- **PaymentProcessingEmail** - Payment processing template
- **PaymentFailedEmail** - Payment failure template
- **PaymentRefundedEmail** - Refund confirmation template

These templates are React components with inline styles for maximum email client compatibility.

<Callout type="tip">
  All templates are already integrated with the email functions. You can customize the templates to match your brand.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### 5. Rate limiting

Magic link emails are automatically rate-limited using Redis to prevent abuse. See the [Rate Limiting guide](/docs/security/rate-limiting) for more details.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type='success'>
  That's it! You're ready to send transactional emails with Resend. All the email functions and templates are pre-built in your template.
