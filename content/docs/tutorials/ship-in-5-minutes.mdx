## Build Your Landing Page

<Steps>
<Step>
### 1. Scaffold your main page

Wipe out everything in `/app/page.tsx` and drop in this starter code:

<CodeBlock title="/app/page.tsx" lang="typescript">
```typescript
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import Header from "@/components/common/Header";
import Hero from "@/components/common/Hero";
import Problem from "@/components/common/Problem";
import FeaturesAccordion from "@/components/common/FeaturesAccordion";
import Pricing from "@/components/common/Pricing";
import FAQ from "@/components/common/FAQ";
import CTA from "@/components/common/CTA";
import Footer from "@/components/common/Footer";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Suspense>
        <Header />
      </Suspense>
      <main>
        <Hero />
        <Problem />
        <FeaturesAccordion />
        <Pricing />
        <FAQ />
        <CTA />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```
</CodeBlock>
</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Make it yours

Edit the text and content to fit your product.  
Every component is designed to help you write copy that sells—see the [components section](/docs/components) for inspiration.

</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### 3. Collect emails (optional)

Want a waitlist? Set up your DB, then uncomment the code in `/api/lead/route.ts` to save emails.

</Step>

<Step>
### 4. Add waitlist buttons (optional)

Swap out the main CTA buttons in `Hero`, `Pricing`, and `CTA` for the waitlist button:

<CodeBlock title="Hero.tsx" lang="typescript">
```typescript
import ButtonLead from "@/components/ButtonLead";

// ...inside your component

{/* For Hero & CTA: */}

<ButtonLead />

{/* For Pricing: */}

<ButtonLead extraStyle="!max-w-none !w-full" />
```
</CodeBlock>
</Step>

<Step>
### 5. Go live locally

Fire up your app:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your landing page.
